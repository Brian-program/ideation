Round 2 submission â€“ five additional user stories. Rayan's idea from round 1.

1. **As a project manager**, I want to track the amount of time my team spends on research and collaboration websites so that I can improve our project timelines and efficiency.

2. **As a habitual online shopper**, I want to monitor the time I spend on shopping sites each week so that I can limit my impulse buying and focus more on saving money.

3. **As a content creator**, I want to understand how much time I spend on social media platforms versus content creation tools so that I can better allocate my time to productive work.

4. **As a digital marketer**, I want to analyze the time spent on different advertising platforms and competitor websites so that I can optimize our marketing strategies and competitive analysis.

5. **As someone trying to improve sleep habits**, I want to track the time I spend on electronics before bedtime so that I can reduce my screen time and improve my sleep quality.
