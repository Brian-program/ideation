# Advanced Gmail Filter Tool

## Overview
The Advanced Gmail Filter Tool extends Gmail's native filtering functionality, enabling users to create complex filter rules based on a combination of conditions, actions, and exceptions. It aims to provide a more dynamic and flexible way to manage incoming emails, reducing clutter and focusing on important messages.

## Features

### Complex Filtering Rules
Users can create filters based on a wide range of criteria, including sender, recipient, subject, keywords within the email body, attachments, and more.

### Conditional Actions
Based on the filters, perform actions such as moving emails to a specific folder, applying labels, marking as read/unread or important, forwarding to another email address, or even deleting.

### Rule Prioritization
Users can prioritize filters to determine which rules should be applied first, preventing conflicts between overlapping rules.

### Scheduled Filters
Allows scheduling certain filters to run only during specified times or days, useful for managing work-life balance.

### Bulk Processing
Apply filters to existing emails in the inbox, not just new incoming emails, helping users to clean up their inbox or organize large volumes of backlogged emails.

### Statistics and Insights
Provide statistics on the emails processed by the filters, such as the number of emails sorted into each label per week, helping users to understand their email habits better.
