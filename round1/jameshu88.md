Problem Statement
Intermediate musicians often spend more time grappling with music production software and getting instruments and quantizing their recordings than making music. If you want to get into music production, why waste time looking for expensive presets and quantizing notes when AI could produce a recording specific to your track? Spend less time and less costs, and spend more time creating.

arget Audience
Music producers, all the way from beginning musicians who need more help with making music to industry professionals who would like to streamline their workflow, automate tedious tasks, and save money on one-time plugins.

Quick Description
The core functionality of the extension is to allow users to hum melodies or tap rhythms, which the AI then analyzes to produce quantized instrument lines tailored to the user's specifications. This process includes timbre transfer, allowing users to experiment with how their vocal lines would sound on different instruments without the need for the actual instrument or a player. Additionally, the tool offers automated quantization and the application of various effects (reverb, chorus, pedal plugins) to enhance the audio recordings, making the music production process more efficient and cost-effective, and gives musicians more time to be creative rather than worry about the technicalities.

Selling Points
Machine-learning based timbre transfers allows for quick idea proliferation to streamline your workflow. Wondering how your vocal line might sound on violin? No need to wait for a violinist! 
Our input takes voice, tapping, and instruments so it’s very flexible.
No need to waste money on expensive reverb, chorus, or pedal plugins just to make a single track sound right. Our plugin automatically tailors these effects specifically to your audio recording.
Quantization is automated for you. Never waste time stretching and squashing your audio file to be on beat again!
Our software is compatible with all major audio files (AIFF, TIFF, WAV, MP3, etc.) and MIDI files so it’s instantly compatible with your workspace. Have an idea? Just hit our plugin, hum, and add any other parameters for how you want it to sound.

Notes

Quantizing all outputs would be easy to implement for simple rhythms. It might be a bit harder for jazz/other genres full of polyrhythms so we might want to include the option for adjusting the swing or pattern of the recording. But it would have to be better than Ableton’s shitty quantization grid!
Huge opportunity for timbre transfer and producing quantized recordings of musicians ideas. Lots of people could definitely use this if done well.
No idea how good machine learning models are at quantization. How costly would it be to link a chrome extension to a ML API too? Would we have to train our own? 
It would be difficult to integrate the chrome extension into the music production workflow itself since it would be a chrome extension and not a DAW like Ableton.

User Stories
I am a music producer seeking to turn my ideas into final products without spending lots of money on plugins and time on quantizing my recordings.
