## Problem Statement
#### Most times we need to have multiple tabs opened to do our tasks. A problem arises when we have multiple tabs open that aren't related to each other but we still need to have them opened for later use. The tabs get too crowded and we have to check each tab to find the one we want. This chrome extension let's users organize tabs into different categories and only display the ones they are currently using.
